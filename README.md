Go PAPAGENO
========

Go PAPAGENO (PArallel PArser GENeratOr) is a parallel parser generator based on Floyd's Operator Precedence Grammars.

It generates parallel Go parsers starting from a lexer and a grammar specification.

The generated parsers are self-contained and can be used without further effort.

This work is based on [Papageno](https://github.com/PAPAGENO-devels/papageno), a C parallel parser generator.

**Note:** at the moment the whole generative part of the project is missing. It is just a parser of arithmetic expressions.
